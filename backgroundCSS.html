Section 1.1: External Stylesheet
An external CSS stylesheet can be applied to any number of HTML documents by placing aelement in each
HTML document.
The attribute rel of thtag has to be set to "stylesheet", and the href attribute to the relative or absolute
path to the stylesheet. While using relative URL paths is generally considered good practice, absolute paths can be
used, too. In HTML5 the type attribute can be omitted.
It is recommended that thetag be placed in the HTML file'sg so that the styles are loaded before
the elements they style. Otherwise, users will see a flash of unstyled content.

Make sure you include the correct path to your CSS file in the href. If the CSS file is in the same folder as your HTML
file then no path is required (like the example above) but if it's saved in a folder, then specify it like this
href="foldername/style.css".
ere's a very simple reason for this: when
you're managing a site of, say, 100 pages, all controlled by a single stylesheet, and you want to change your link

colors from blue to green, it's a lot easier to make the change in your CSS file and let the changes "cascade"
throughout all 100 pages than it is to go into 100 separate pages and make the same change 100 times. Again, if
you want to completely change the look of your website, you only need to update this one file.
You can load as many CSS files in your HTML page as needed.
CSS rules are applied with some basic rules, and order does matter. For example, if you have a main.css file with
some code in it:
p.green { color: #00FF00; }
All your paragraphs with the 'green' class will be written in light green, but you can override this with another .css
file just by including it after main.css. You can have override.css with the following code follow main.css, for
example:
p.green { color: #006600; }
Now all your paragraphs with the 'green' class will be written in darker green rather than light green.
Other principles apply, such as the '!important' rule, specificity, and inheritance.
When someone first visits your website, their browser downloads the HTML of the current page plus the linked CSS
file. Then when they navigate to another page, their browser only needs to download the HTML of that page; the
CSS file is cached, so it does not need to be downloaded again. Since browsers cache the external stylesheet, your
pages load faster.
Section 1.2: Internal Styles
CSS enclosed iags within an HTML document functions like an external stylesheet, except that
it lives in the HTML document it styles instead of in a separate file, and therefore can only be applied to the
document in which it lives. Note that this element must be inside thelement for HTML validation (though it

Section 1.3: CSS @import rule (one of CSS at-rule)
The @import CSS at-rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets. These rules must precede all other
types of rules, except @charset rules; as it is not a nested statement, @import cannot be used inside conditional
group at-rules. @import.
How to use @import
You can use @imp
The following line imports a CSS file named additional-styles.css in the root directory into the CSS file in which it
appears:
@import '/additional-styles.css';
Importing external CSS is also possible. A common use case are font files.

An optional second argument to @import rule is a list of media queries:
@import '/print-styles.css' print;
@import url('landscape.css') screen and (orientation:landscape);
Section 1.4: Inline Styles
Use inline styles ss various email clients, programs
and devices, but can be time-consuming to write and a bit challenging to manage.
Section 1.5: Changing CSS with JavaScript
